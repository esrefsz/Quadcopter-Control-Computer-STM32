# Flight-Control-Computer-Desing Project
**This is a project I did for the undergraduate design course of Istanbul Technical University.

**The aim of the project is to provide the flight of a quadcopter by communicating with a microcontroller and an IMU sensor, with the necessary filters and PWM signals to 4 different motors with the controllers.

**It is written in C language and on STM32G071RB microcontroller.

**Implemented filter is Kalman Filter and controller is PID.

**The reciever used is radiolink R8EF, the transmitter is radiolink T8FB.

**MPU6050 sensor is used for IMU.

**"Design Board .jpg" shows the links of the pins.

**The "Flight Control Computer Source Code" file contains STM32 codes and config settings. "Senior Design Project Report.pdf" is the report I wrote for this project with my teammates.
